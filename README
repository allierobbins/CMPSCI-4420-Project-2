This is the README file for Allie Robbins' Digital Image Assignment 2

All files were written in C++ on Visual Studio 2017, referencing OpenCV 3.4.1.

List of Files included in program:
  - program1
  - program2
  - program3
  - program4
  - program5
  - program6
  - makefile
  - README

Four image files were included in the directory for testing, including:
  - astronaut.jpg
  - astronautbw.jpg
  - astronautbw1.jpg
  - noisy_backyard.jpg

To execute the program:
    Run command "make" to build/compile the programs.
    Run command "./programName imageName" to run a program after it is built.

To clean the object files:
    Run command "make clean".

Purpose of program:
    The purpose of this program is perform image transformations and gather statistical data.

Outline of Assignment 2 by program:
  - PROGRAM 1: Write a program to compare two grayscale images of the same size.
      Compute the average distance between corresponding pixel intensity levels.

  - PROGRAM 2: Write a function to convert a color image to a greyscale image.
      Compute the distance of your greyscale-converted image from the
      grayscale conversion by OpenCV using the program from program1.cpp.

  - PROGRAM 3: Write a program that will provide some statistical information on gray
      scale images. Find the average value of pixels and the standard deviation.
      Plot a 256Ã—256 histogram with the data.

  - PROGRAM 4: Write a program to subsample a grayscale image by removing alternate
  	  rows and columns.

  - PROGRAM 5: Write a program to split a grayscale image into bit planes.
  	  Save the bit planes and display them on screen.

  - PROGRAM 6: Write functions to flip and flop an image in-place.
